rp-pppoe (3.3-1.2) stable-security; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload by the Security Team
  * Added patch by Max Vozeler <max@hinterhof.net> to ignore -D and -p
    when pppoe is not running as root to prevent a potential root
    compromise when pppoe is running setuid root [src/pppoe.c,
    CAN-2004-0564]

rp-pppoe (3.0-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Remove -arp switch from ppp_on_boot and pppoe wrapper. This breaks
    networks were the DSL modem is connected to a hub and not directly to
    a network interface. (Closes: #100833)

 -- Christian Hudon <chrish@debian.org>  Thu, 14 Jun 2001 13:52:42 -0400

rp-pppoe (3.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added instructions on how to set up pppoe to work with pon, for people
    that are billed by their DSL provider for minutes connected. (Which is
    somewhat odd...)
  * Wrapper around pppoe to automatically bring up the interface that will
    be used by pppoe. Needed for pon support because /etc/network/interfaces
    doesn't support bringing up an interface without assigning it an
    IP address, and pon doesn't support the execution of arbitrary
    commands before the execution of pppd. (Well, except for ppp_on_boot,
    which we don't want to use in this case.)
  * Also added instructions on how to use demand-dialing.
  * Corrected thinko in README.Debian file.

  * Modifications and improvements from changes suggested by Eduard Bloch.

    ppp.
