pppoe: a PPP-over-Ethernet redirector for pppd
Copyright (C) 1999 Roaring Penguin Software Inc.
Much inspiration from an earlier client by Luke Stras.

Introduction
============

pppoe is a user-space redirector which permits the use of PPPoE
(Point-to-Point Over Ethernet) with Linux.  PPPoE is used by many
ADSL service providers.

To read the manual page, type:

	nroff -man pppoe.8 | more

Installation
============

Requirements
------------

1) Linux 2.2.9 or later (may work on other platforms, but untested)
                      has been tested on Intel platforms
   OR
   Linux 2.0.36 or later (UNTESTED)

2) pppd 2.3.10 or later.  Versions 2.3.7 and later are rumored to work,
   but I haven't tested them personally.

Compiling
---------

Compile and install pppd.  Then:

1) Unpack:

# tar xzvf rp-pppoe-xxx.tar.gz

2) Configure:

# ./configure

3) Compile:

# make

4) Install to some convenient directory:

# cp pppoe /usr/local/bin

5) Create an appropriate secrets file.  For example, Sympatico ADSL uses
PAP for authentication, so we need an /etc/ppp/pap-secrets file.  The
file consists of three columns, separated by whitespace.  The first
column is the user name.  For Sympatico, this is the Sympatico Member
ID (b1*).  This is case sensitive, and you must add '@sympatico.ca' to
the end.  The second entry is the server name.  This should be '*'.
The third entry is the secret.  For Sympatico users, this will be your
Sympatico password.  So a sample /etc/ppp/pap-secrets file might look
like:

b1aaaaaa@sympatico.ca * password

6) Make sure your Ethernet interface is up:

ifconfig eth0 up

7) Set up DNS.  If your ISP gave you the IP addresses of DNS servers, put
   lines in /etc/resolv.conf which look like this:

	nameserver ip_addr_of_first_dns_server
	nameserver ip_addr_of_second_dns_server

For example:

	nameserver 204.101.251.1
	nameserver 204.101.251.2

8) Then, start pppd like this:

pppd pty '/usr/local/bin/pppoe -I eth0' noipdefault defaultroute \
     hide-password passive persist name b1aaaaaa@sympatico.ca

See the script "adsl-connect" for a robust connection script which
restarts the link if it goes down.  See "HOW-TO-CONNECT" for a simple
recipe for making an ADSL connection and answers to common problems.
The "adsl-state.pl" script examines your log files and summarizes the
availability of your connection.
